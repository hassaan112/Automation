# Automation
An assortment of random automation programs/scripts made by me.

These could range anything from pointless yet amusing, to mildly interesting stuff. I mostly just made all these to experiment with, and learn different modules and libraries. 

Go ahead and test these out for yourself, or play with the values and code to optimize them further.
